# nf-core/demultiplex: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [bcl-convert](#bcl-convert) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [bases2fastq](#bases2fastq) - converting bases files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [bcl2fastq](#bcl2fastq) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [sgdemux](#sgdemux) - demultiplexing bgzipped fastq files produced by Singular Genomics (CONDITIONAL)
- [fqtk](#fqtk) - demultiplexing fastq files (CONDITIONAL)
- [fastp](#fastp) - Adapter and quality trimming
- [Falco](#falco) - Raw read QC
- [md5sum](#md5sum) - Creates an MD5 (128-bit) checksum of every fastq.
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - aggregate report, describing results of the whole pipeline

### fastp

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*.fastp.html`: Trimming report in html format.
  - `*.fastp.json`: Trimming report in json format.
  - `*.fastp.log`: Trimming log file.

</details>

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a tool designed to provide fast, all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files. It has been developed in C++ with multithreading support to achieve higher performance. fastp is used in this pipeline for standard adapter trimming and quality filtering.

### Falco

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.txt`: Txt containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file.
  - `*_summary.txt`: Txt containing the summary metrics.

> **NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, demultiplexed reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality.

</details>

[Falco](https://github.com/smithlabcode/falco) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences.

:::note
The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### md5sum

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `<flowcell_id>/`
  - `*.fastq.gz.md5`: MD5 checksum of fastq

</details>

Creates an MD5 (128-bit) checksum of every fastq.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
