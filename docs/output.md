# nf-core/demultiplex: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [bcl-convert](#bcl2fastq) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- [bases2fastq](#bases2fastq) - converting bcl files to fastq, and demultiplexing (CONDITIONAL)
- Processes that only run if there are 10X samples on the sample sheet input (CONDITIONAL):
  - [CellRanger](#cellranger) - demultiplexes raw base call (BCL) files generated by Illumina sequencers into FASTQ files and is a wrapper around Illumina's bcl2fastq
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - aggregate report, describing results of the whole pipeline

### bcl-convert

[bcl-convert](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl-convert.html) Conversion Software both demultiplexes data and converts BCL files generated by Illumina sequencing systems to standard FASTQ file formats for downstream analysis.

**Output directory: `params.outdir/projectName/FastQ`**

- `samplename/sample.fastq.gz`
  - Untrimmed raw fastq files

### bases2fastq

TODO: add info for bases2fastq @emiller

### CellRanger

[CellRanger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell RNA-seq output to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis. `cellranger mkfastq` demultiplexes raw base call (BCL) files generated by Illumina sequencers into FASTQ files and is a wrapper around Illumina's bcl2fastq. `cellranger count` takes FASTQ files from `cellranger mkfastq` and performs alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting. It uses the Chromium cellular barcodes to generate feature-barcode matrices, determine clusters, and perform gene expression analysis.

`cellranger mkfastq`

**Output directory: `params.outdir/mkfastq/outs/fastq_path/project_name/sample_name/`**

- `samplename/sample.fastq.gz`
  - Untrimmed raw fastq files

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
