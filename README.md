### Introduction
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.



### Documentation
The nf-core/demultiplex pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:

1. [Installation](docs/installation.md)
2. Pipeline configuration
    * [Local installation](docs/configuration/local.md)
    * [Adding your own system](docs/configuration/adding_your_own.md)
    * [Reference genomes](docs/configuration/reference_genomes.md)  
3. [Running the pipeline](docs/usage.md)
4. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)
5. [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add a brief overview of what the pipeline does and how it works -->
